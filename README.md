# Vuex2-Examples

I used a free template [Osahan – Free CV Resume/Vcard HTML5 Template](https://graygrids.com/item/osahan-free-cv-resumevcard-html5-template/)
to demonstrate some of the features remarkable library [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/). 

This package can Build reactive Web user interfaces.

It can process HTML templates to generate Web application views that be composed by different parts.

## Installing

## Overview Vue.js

Main features of the Vue.js:

- Reactivity.
- Components .
- Modularity.
- Animations.
- Routing.
- Stability.

Vue.js (pronounced /vjuː/, like view) is a library for building interactive web interfaces. 
The goal of Vue.js is to provide the benefits of reactive data binding and composable 
view components with an API that is as simple as possible.

Vue.js itself is not a full-blown framework - it is focused on the view layer only. 
It is therefore very easy to pick up and to integrate with other libraries or 
existing projects. On the other hand, when used in combination with proper tooling 
and supporting libraries, Vue.js is also perfectly capable of powering sophisticated 
Single-Page Applications.

If you are an experienced frontend developer and want to know how Vue.js compares 
to other libraries/frameworks, check out the [Comparison with Other Frameworks](http://vuejs.org/guide/comparison.html); 
if you are more interested about how Vue.js approaches larger-scale applications, 
check out the section on [Building Larger-Scale Applications](http://vuejs.org/guide/application.html).

### Compatibility Note

Vue.js does not support IE8 and below, because Vue.js uses ECMAScript 5 features 
that are un-shimmable in IE8. However Vue.js supports all [ECMAScript 5 compliant browsers](http://caniuse.com/#feat=es5).
