## Overview Vuex

### What is a "State Management Pattern"? 

Vuex is a `state management pattern + library` for [Vue.js](http://vuejs.org/) applications. 
It serves as a centralized store for all the components in an application, 
with rules ensuring that the state can only be mutated in a predictable fashion. 
It also integrates with Vue's official [devtools extension](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) to provide advanced 
features such as zero-config time-travel debugging and state snapshot export / import.
